#gem 'carrierwave'  #CarrierWave is more flexible than Paperclip. It is based on Rack, which means that it works with Rails, Sinatra and other Rack-based Ruby applications, and it supports a variety of ORMs including ActiveRecord, DataMapper, Mongoid. Another significant difference between CarrierWave and Paperclip is that CarrierWave keeps everything in a separate Uploader class so that all of the file attachments and the processing logic belongs there. This way file attachments don’t end up mixed with the application’s model classes.
